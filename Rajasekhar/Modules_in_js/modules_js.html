    <!-- 1.Export and Import Basics:
    Create a file math.js that exports two functions, add(a, b) and subtract(a, b). Create another file app.js that imports these functions and uses them to add and subtract two numbers.
    
    2.Default Export:
    In a file greeting.js, export a default function greet(name) that returns a greeting message. Import this function in app.js and use it to greet a user.
    
    3.Named Exports:
    Create a file user.js that exports two named functions, getUser(name) and setUser(name). Import these functions in app.js and use them to set and get a user's name.
    
    4.Combining Default and Named Exports:
    In calculator.js, create a default export function divide(a, b) and a named export function multiply(a, b). Import these functions in app.js and use them in calculations.
    
    5.Renaming Imports:
    Create a file mathOperations.js that exports a function calculateSum(a, b). Import this function in app.js, but rename it to sum during import, and use it to calculate the sum of two numbers.
    
    6.Multiple Named Exports:
    In stringUtils.js, export three functions: toUpperCase(str), toLowerCase(str), and capitalize(str). Import and use these functions in app.js to manipulate a string.
    
    7.Exporting Objects:
    Create a file config.js that exports an object containing application settings like appName, version, and author. Import this object in app.js and log the application details.
    
    8.Exporting Classes:
    In Person.js, create and export a class Person with properties name and age. Add a method getDetails() that returns the person's details. Import and use this class in app.js.
    
    9.Circular Imports:
    Create two files, moduleA.js and moduleB.js. Export a function from each that imports and calls a function from the other module. Observe how circular imports are handled in ES6.
    
    10.Re-exporting Modules:
    Create two files, math.js and string.js, each exporting some functions. Create a third file index.js that re-exports all functions from math.js and string.js. Import everything in app.js and use it.
    
    11.Named Exports and Imports:
     Create a file stringUtils.js that exports two functions capitalize and lowercase. In app.js, import only the capitalize function and use it.
    
    12.Create a file mathOperations.js that exports a default function subtract(a, b) and also a named function multiply(a, b). In app.js, import both and use them.   -->
