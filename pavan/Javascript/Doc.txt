Variables : its nothing but container  which store different kinds datatypes 
 datatypes :values -string ,boolean numbers arrays etc 

Declaration :creation of Variables,function class  etc..
 var a;
 a: identifier :

Rules For Writing/declaring the varaible/function Names (identifier)
1.it shouldnot  contain special charater except $ and _
2.it shouldnot start with numbers 
3.it should not reserved keyword (function ,for ,var let const )
4.it shouldnot white space (full name❌) -->full_name -->fullName 

different ways Declare in js 
1.use var keyword--->1995 
2.use let keyword --->es6 (2015)
3.use const keyword --->es6 (2015)
4.without any keyword -->global


REDEClARATION : creation of varaible with same Name with in the same scope ;
var a;
var a;
INITIALAZATION : assiging a value at time of  creation/Declaration or after creation 

scope: lifetime of varaible (accessibility of varaible) 
 different types of scope : 
    global scope : it accessible everywhere with in code 
    local scope : 
       block_scope : {}
       function scope : function example(){}
       module scope : the code in one file can accessble within other js files 


HOISTING : moving all Declaration to top of there scope 
hoisting is a behavior where declarations of variables and functions are moved to the top of their scope before the code is executed.


Temporal Dead Zone:
This is the period from the start of a scope until the let or const declaration is reached during execution. In the TDZ, you cannot access the variable, even though it's "known" to exist by the JavaScript engine. 

Modules :
 
 Types of modules :
        common js module :  (before ) 
             require("module-library/name") //eg : react redux bootstrap-icons fonts   //using the code
             exports.filename/module //sharing the code 
        Esm : 
            import  module from "module-library"  // using the code 
            export modulename  //sharing the code  


            Types of Exports and Imports 
              Types of Exports 
                Named export : we need to give the same function varaible ,object etc  where ever using(importing) it
                         named export can n for a file  

                         ex: export var a=10
                         ex: export var b=10

                 default exports : we can  import with any name  
                                default export should one for file 
                           ex: export default var c=20
                  Types of Imports 
                     Named imports  : we need to import with same name
                      import {a,b} from "./filename"
                     default Imports : we can import with any name 
                      import cvalue from "./filename"
